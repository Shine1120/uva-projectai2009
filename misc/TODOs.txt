TODOs:

- [V] integrate JM strong classifier in the combined classifier  
- [X] output best model for T=2 for combined classifier
- [X] more repetition/trials to filter out margin
- [X] create images for the best regions
- [X] subtracting mean from bills (to get intensity invariance)
- [X] build presentation!!!
- [X] produce results on the same grid (21x3 preferably)
- [X] redo histogram plots (front and rear)
- [X] check out overlapping areas (haar and edge/intensity)




A correct title voor Haar:
- convolution with Haar filters


Q: overfitting in JM code? [V]
Q: validation set reliable? [V]
Q: does it make sense to increase the dataset by adding gaussian noise? [V]
